This code in conjunction with an Arduino/Ethernet Shield and a feed setup on
Pachube will server as a X10 Bridge.

The code and hardware combination will monitor a given data feed on Pachube 
looking for X10 commands.  These X10 commands will then be routed to the 
local X10 setup using a X10 Powerline Interface.

The details of how this is all setup is at the following URL
